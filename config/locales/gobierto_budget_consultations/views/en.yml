          explain_balance_html: "<h4 class='tip-headline'>Balance</h4><p>Fanstic!
            With your decisions the budget is balanced: The income and the expenses
            %{of_the_organization_name} will be the same and we won't need to increase
            our debt.</p>"
          explain_deficit_html: "<h4 class='tip-headline'>Deficit or surplus?</h4><p>Wit
            your decisions will be spending more than the income, so we'll be generating
            new debt. This isn't bad necessarily, if the amount is reasonable for
            the city council to pay. But if %{our_organization_name} already has debt,
            we'll make it grow and we'll need to pay more interests.</p>"
          explain_surplus_html: "<h4 class='tip-headline'>Surplus</h4><p>With your
            decisions will spend less than the income this year. That means we could
            invest that money in paying debt, in case the council has it. Or maybe
            it makes sense to spend more money. Think about it!</p>"
